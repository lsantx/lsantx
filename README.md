  <b>I'm an enthusiast of two things: technology and everything related to renewable energy sources. That's why I added these areas in my professional career. I graduated in electrical engineering at Federal University of Vi√ßosa and got my Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering at Federal University of Minas Gerais in 2022. I'm currently CTO at Digital Grid, managing the development of technologies for energy sector applications.<\b>
